# How many trips in the sample_training.trips collection started at stations that are to the west of the -74 longitude coordinate?
# 
# Longitude decreases in value as you move west.
# 
# Note: We always list the longitude first and then latitude in the coordinate pairs; i.e.
# 
# <field_name>: [ <longitude>, <latitude> ]
